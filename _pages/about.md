I am a PhD Student in the Sensing, Learning, and Inference Group at MIT CSAIL advised by [John W. Fisher III](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fisher/) as part of the MIT / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Joint Program.

Previously, I worked at the Samsung AI Center in New York on robotic manipulation and on exploration in deep reinforcement learning. I also spent time at Oculus applying computer vision and machine learning to human body tracking with the People AI team as well as on developing and launching the [Rift S](https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/).

In my spare time, I enjoy running, photography, and all things nature-related.
