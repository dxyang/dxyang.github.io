I'm a machine learning researcher and software engineer working on building robotics systems that can interact with the world.

Previously, I worked at Oculus on applying computer vision/machine learning to human body tracking with the People AI team as well as on developing the [Rift S](https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/).

In my spare time, I enjoy running, photography, and all things nature-related.
